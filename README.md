# Cipher-Project

A couple of primitive neural network algorithms produced as part of a third year project investigating the Bifid cipher.

Tensorflow and Python 3.5+ are required.

Both algorithms are functional and should open a menu system when run. However, both are flawed and require significant work if they are to be used to break the Bifid cipher (as intended).
